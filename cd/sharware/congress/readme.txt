    The  games  PARSEC  MAN  3D  and  PROGRESS  or  CONGRESS  are
    Shareware products.
    
    
    The games are complete,  although I may add additional levels
    and other features in the future.    If  you  enjoy either of
    these games, I would very much appreciate  hearing  from you.
    If  you  are  so  inclined,  I  would also  very  much  enjoy
    receiving  a  registration  fee.  I can assure you  that  the
    registration fee will encourage me to produce more and better
    games.    
    
    The  GAME-MAKER  game  engine,  upon  which these  games  are
    running, is licensed by me for use in  Shareware.    Yes, the
    GAME-MAKER  Shareware game license is granted to everyone who
    purchases a copy of GAME-MAKER, but the GAME-MAKER guys spent
    years  developing the engine and I would like to send them  a
    wee bit  of  your  registration  fee in appreciation of their
    efforts and their help.
    
    May I suggest  a  registration  fee  of  between  $7 and $15,
    depending on your personal  enjoyment and the number of games
    you are registering.  If  you  have  just one of my games and
    would like the other, please send  $15  and  let me know your
    address and the game that you don't  have.    Probably,  I'll
    send you new copies of both and maybe  a  third  (whatever  I
    have ready and whatever fits on the disk!).
    
    Oh yes....not only was the game designed and drawn by myself,
    but the music was composed by myself as well.  Enjoy!
