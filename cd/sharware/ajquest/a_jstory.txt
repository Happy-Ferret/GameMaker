While  listening  in  on  evil
prince Ostro's  plans  to take
over the town of Beartown, A-J
Bear  and  his  pet  hedgehog,
Hedge, was captured and thrown
into an  abandoned  warehouse.

Ostro  has  employed  gigantic
pretzels  as minions  in   his
campaign of conquest.

A-J  must   get  out   of  the
warehouse  and  find  Ostro to
save his home town.  Ostro has
frozen  four  of    Beartown's
princes    into  indestuctible
force fields.    YOU WILL NEED
THEIR  CROWNS  and  any  other
crowns  you  can find  to  get
through  the  doors  to  their
domains.

Will A-J make it?   Don't tune
in  next  week,  because  only
your skill,  used  right away,
will  give  the    world   the
answer!
