**********A-J'S QUEST:**************
The original namesake for A-J Games!
While listening in on evil Prince
Ostro's plans to take over Bearton
with giant pretzels, A-J Bear was
captured and thrown into an aban-
doned warehouse with his hedgehog,
Hedge. A-J's quest is a graphical
tour-de-force, with a great sound-
track and Sound Blaster sound ef-
fects. There are five levels and
five bonus stages. This game is the
top!
