  Hedrick H. Hogg has been in-
vited  to  the most  important
tea of his life:  Tea with the
Queen!
  Unfortunately,   the   royal
house is out of crumpets. Hed-
rick  has been  told to  bring
one  hundred crumpets when  he
comes to tea.
  "One   hundred   CRUMPETS!",
moaned Hedrick. "How am I ever
to get those? Well, I have ten
here.   I  only  need  ninety!
Wow!"
  He'll  find the  rest if he
looks hard enough (Hopefully).
