 "Good noon, Hedrick. Have you
brought  the  crumpets,  as  I
requested?"
 "Yes, Your Highness.  I had a
devil  of  a  time  scrabbling
these together,  but here they
are."
 "I was about  to state to you
that we won't be needing these
items,  nice as  they are.  We
have  fallen   upon  biscuits,
rather.  I am ever so sorry to
put  you through such  a jour-
ney.   I   don't   understand,
though,  why you didn't merely
pop off to the grocery."
