Graphics, Sound, Control, Ani-
mation,  Character idea,  Mon-
ster  ideas,  Maps,  and  most
everything  else were  done by
Eric-Jon Waugh. The background
music was done  by quite a few
people.  Recreational Software
Designs,  Creative  Labs,  and
Ronnie Toon  wrote  the  music
used at this time.  Soon, how-
ever,  The music will also  be
credited to E-J.  Thanks,  RSD
and Oliver! This game was made
with Game-Maker,  a product of
Recreational Software Designs.
