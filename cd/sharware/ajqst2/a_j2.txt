When  the  evil  Prince  Ostro
tried  to invade the  town  of
Bearton  with  giant  pretzels
A-J  Bear  and  his  hedgehog,
Hedge  stopped him.

Ostro has  escaped and Andrew-
Jonathan  has gotten  together
three  of his friends  to help
him recapture him: Arthur Bru-
in, Freeport  Grizzly, and Sa-
sha Medvyed.  Each has his own
route, as they are vacationing
in  totally  different  places
from one another. A-J, though,
must  be the one,  once again,
to  destroy  Ostro.  Together,
they  can  hopefully  save the
city again..
