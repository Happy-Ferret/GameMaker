Up, down, left, and right make
A-J,  Freeport, Sasha,  or Ar-
thur  walk that  way.  Up-left
and  up-right (7 and 9  on the
numerical  keypad)  make  your
character  jump  that way.  Up
launches  the   character  up-
wards,   and  down  makes  him
duck.  When you tap the  space
bar,  you attack with the most
powerful  weapon   you've  ob-
tained,  so  far.  The "B" key
rolls  a bomb toward an  enemy
if  you've  accuired  any  ex-
plosives.

The  most  powerful weapon  is
the frizbee.  After that comes
the  slingshot.  These  have a
limited supply of ammo, so you
need  to snag more,  along the
way.  The third  strongest  is
the wooden sword.  The weakest
weapon there is is the yo-yo..
