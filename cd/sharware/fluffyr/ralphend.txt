At  the  end  of  limbo,  Ralf
spots a hole.  through it, the
Earth  can  be seen.  Quacking
with joy,  Ralf  goes  rushing
towards it.  As  he  starts to
rush  through  the  hole,   he
smacks into something  as hard
as  the bagels  in the back of
your fridge.  Looking up, ralf
notices a message floating be-
fore him,  reading  "You Can't
Get  There From Here!"  Disbe-
lieving,   Ralf  tries  to  go
through again, yet the message
is still there. Saddened, Ralf
plods home,to try another day.
