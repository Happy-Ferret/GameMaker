This   is  a  shareware   game
invented by A-J Games. In case
you  don't have  a clue  as to
what shareware is,  here's how
it goes.  You get a  shareware
program  from  a friend,  mail
order company, etc.  Next, you
use it. Third, if you like it,
you register it.  If not, dis-
continue  using  it  within  a
month. Shareware may be copied
and passed on to your friends,
Romans,  and  countrymen,  put
on BBS's,  eaten  with  a side
order  of toast,  or  whatever
you  want  to do  with it,  as
long as you don't hack it. The
REGISTERED software,  however,
may NOT be done  anything with
except used by you,  yourself,
and ye.

There are many  other games by
us which you can register for,
besides this one.  In fact, we
have some fantastic games ONLY
available   through  registra-
tion. All support Sound Blast-
er and  most  SVGA  boards and
require  a 286 or faster,  VGA
or SVGA, and a lot of space on
your hard drive.
