If  you  press the  up,  down,
right,  or  left  arrow,  Ralf
will walk that way.  The space
bar reflects light off of your
magnifying   glass,   and  "P"
picks  things  up.

There  are many items in  this
world  which   are  useful  to
Ralf.  Here's  the  lowdown on
them.

  Magnifying  Glasses:   Using
    these,  you  can focus  a
    beam of light at an enemy.

  Double   Time   Shoes:   Run
    twice  as  fast  when  you
    slip these on.

  Keys:  Use these to open the
    chests other stuff is kept
    in.

  Green Crystals:  The remains
    of some creature.  When an
    organic life form dies, it
    leaves its life force cry-
    stal  behind.  These  last
    for ever, unless broken.

  1's,   O's,   X's:   Strange
    structures  of  metal  and
    plastic  which  have  been
    left all over the place by
    some   unknown   creature.
    They may have special pow-
    ers to chicken-ducks.

  Chests: Mostly everything is
    stored  away in  chests so
    it  won't  be damaged.  Of
    course, it's nearly impos-
    sible to get anything out
    again, but . . .

Throughout Noniyan,  there are
many  devices from which  mon-
sters  repeatedly pop  out of,
from  some  unknown  location.
Ralf  needs  to destroy  these
devices on his way,  trying to
clean  his world,  even though
he won't be there much longer.

Ralf  Starts off  in  his  own
village.  He has heard that in
one of the  buildings there is
a secret  entrance  to a  dun-
geon, far below.  This dungeon
is the link  between Noniyan's
countryside  and the  Lands of
the Surreal. At the end of the
Lands,  a rip lies,  according
to the elders' tales. This rip
takes  one through the  dimen-
tional  barrier.  On the other
side   of  the   barrier . . .
paradise awaits.
