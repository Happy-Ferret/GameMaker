PAC,  also  know  as  Periodic
Andim  Cleaner,  has a job  to
do.  The Andims are sectors of
the artificially created world
of Zlexianr (zlecks-EE-an-er).
They    occasionally    become
filled  with small  spheres of
unknown orgin.  These orbs are
known to explode. Here's where
PAC comes into the picture. He
is  an   artificially  created
life  form,  specially  engin-
eered to be  resistant to  the
orbs'  powers.   In  fact,  he
loves them. He, however, can't
digest the  larger pink  ones.
He stores  these in a  special
pouch inside his stomach until
he has the opportunity to spit
them out.  PAC does  this with
such force,  it destroys  vir-
tually  anything in  its path.
Clening the  Andims isn't easy
for  PAC,  though.   His  body
structure, sad to say, is very
weak.  It would only  take one
good  whollup  to  finish  him
off.  To make his mission even
harder,  there   are   strange
creatures wandering everywhere
in the Andims, now.  They just
appeared a  few days ago,  but
have  already  chased  all  of
the residents away. PAC has to
deal with them.  The army will
take  care of them when  PAC's
done. If he gets rid of one or
two,  himself,  though,  he'll
get a  nice bonus.  Off to the
Andims!!
