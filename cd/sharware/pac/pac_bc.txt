      (FREEWARE=FREE!).

The only  condition I have for
your  use of PAC is to  please
not sell it.  Other than that,
do  anything you want  to with
it.  This is my only  Freeware
game, so enjoy it as you will.
If  you  think PAC  is  great,
good,   so-so,   or  mediocre,
please send me  $1 for a cata-
log of my other games.  You'll
also  be on  my mailing  list,
unless  you specify not to be.
My address is:

   HEY! SOMEONE LIKES PAC!
      5 Morrill Street
   Winthrop, ME 04364-1220

Thanks.
