YOU  ARE  TRANSPORTED  TO  THE
     PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE.

Congradulations,  PAC!  You've
cleared the way for the exter-
minators to come through,  and
have  done a little  pest rid-
dence,  yourself.  You've even
destroyed  the bezerk  machine
which was making the orbs. You
will be operated on,  as a re-
ward, to make your body struc-
ture  twenty   times  stronger
than  it is now.  You have the
thanks of all the planet. Live
your life in harmony.
