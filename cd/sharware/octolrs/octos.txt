Octolris is a kind of gelatan-
ous octopus -- the only one of
his  species.   While  he  was
florping around  --  and,  be-
lieve me,  this action is well
named -- he got snagged in the
net of a crazed  sushi fishing
ship and bludgeoned  by one of
the workers  before  he  could 
escape. Yes, Octolris can live
on land for a short while, but
he dries up and needs slime to
coat his body regularly.  When
his body  is  totally  covered
with the stuff, it becomes ad-
hesive  to  walls,  and  such.
Anyway,  when he awoke  in the
`Fish-house',  as  the workers
called it,  he wriggled out of
the  net.  Now,  back  to  the
ocean!
