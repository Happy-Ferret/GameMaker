WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH!!!!!

Though Octolris originally as-
sumed that he should've gone
to the docks, his journeys
brought him to a tank of wa-
ter, in the center of a disco.
Peering into the water, he
could see no immediate bottom.
Taking a chance, Octolris hop-
ped in. The current carried
him through a dark drain, and
ultimately to the ocean. How
this was possible, he had no
idea. He didn't care, really.
He was home..
