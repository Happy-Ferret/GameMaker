    Octolris was made by the same team who brought you hits like A-J's
 Quest and Fluffy Ralph, so don't be fooled by thinking that a game with
 a slime octopus is strange . . .Well, it's not THAT strange. All right.
 Stop laughing. I get your point. Anyway, if you register this (only $20!),
 you'll get five more rounds, instead of being stuck with the lame-o --
 whoops!  I mean, SNAZZY ending you'll recieve if you finish this version.
 All right, let me put it another way . . .REGISTER THIS BEFORE I KILL YOU!
 There. That's taken care of.
    Type OCTOLRIS to start the game.  If you ever need to reconfigure the
 game, merely type CONFIG.  The only thing you should know right off the bat
 is that F1 is, in computer language, HELP!!!!!!!.  This not only applies to
 this game, but to mostly any other game you'll likely find.  There.  You
 learn something new every day.


     The game Octolris is a copyright of A-J Games, which, in turn, is a
 copyright of Eric-Jon Waugh.  I seriously doubt you care, but you're not 
 supposed to be interested.  You're supposed to skip over this, you twit.
 Go play the game!  Gad!  The people I meet around here!
