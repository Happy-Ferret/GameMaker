The games and tools found in the Shareware subdirectories
are Shareware.  This means that these games and tools are
copyrighted by their owners.  As with other Shareware, you
may try out each of the games and tools, but if you want
to continue to use them, you should follow their registration
instructions.

This means that unlike the gameware found in the GAMEWARE
directory, the gameware within the Shareware games should
not be used in your own games without permission of the
owners.

Recreational Software Designs would like to thank the many
Game-Maker users that contributed Shareware games.
