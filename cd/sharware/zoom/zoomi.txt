Overhead view:
    Up, down, left, and right
    steer Zoom those ways. The
    space bar shoots a ray of
    magic from Zoom's fist
    when you have any magic
    dust.

Side view:
    Up-left, up, up-right, and
    down make zoom fly left,
    up, right, and down. Left
    and right make zoom walk
    those ways. "B" shoots a
    ray of magic to the left,
    and "N", to the right.
