"Hi. I'm A-J Bear. This is the
story of  how my cousin became
super. It was all an accident,
really.   Grandpa  Merlin  was
busy conjuring a  spell in his
den.  Cousin Zoom wasn't aware
of it.  Thus,  when Zoom  came
into  Grandpa's  Den  to watch
the  telly,  Grandpa was  dis-
tracted  and  his  spell  went
awry,  striking  Zoom  to  the
floor.  Grandpa rushed over to
him.  He didn't have any  idea
what would  happen.  He didn't
even know  what the spell  was
about.   When  Grandpa  lifted
Zoom up,  Zoom awakened.  Now,
to  spare your  ears,  I won't
go into the exact details, but
the spell gave Zoom  the power
to fly.  Also, whenever he had
a  supply  of  magic dust,  he
was  able  to  emit  a ray  of
magic from  his clenched fist.
Grandma made a simple costume,
according  to   Zoom's  wants,
consisting of  a blue mask and
a red cape with a large yellow
"Z" on it.  Now? Well, I think
he said he was gonna go find a
card of some sort.   He'd bet-
ter get home soon, though,  or
he'll be late for work  at the
library."
