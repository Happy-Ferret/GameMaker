                           PAPER AIRPLANE


    To run  PAPER  AIRPLANE,  unzip the SPAP.ZIP file, preferably
    into its own  subdirectory.   Then at the MS-DOS prompt type:
    SPAP.

    Before PAPER AIRPLANE runs,  it  will  ask  for some hardware
    configuration data so that the  software  can  use your sound
    card  and SVGA video card properly.    You  may  change  this
    configuration data at a later time by  typing  CONFIG  at the
    MS-DOS prompt.
