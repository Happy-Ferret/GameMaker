You appear in  a strange world
made  entirely  of  grids  and
filled  with  weird  creatures
which turn flesh to stone at a
touch.  You  must escape.  You
have nothing with you,  so you
must  use  your  martial  arts
skills to survive,  though you
doubt  you  will.  There  is a
special drink,  however, which
protects  slightly  anyone who
consumes it from the monsters'
deadly  touch,  and  you  must
drink as much as possible when
you find it.
