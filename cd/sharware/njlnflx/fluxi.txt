The up, down, left, and right
arrow keys move the ship in
those directions. Tapping the
space bar shoots, while hit-
ting Enter drops a missile.

There is a secret way out of
every round, and until you
find it you will loop through
the round continuously.

     TIP:
When you gain a spinning
shield, try not to shoot, as
you will likely destroy your
protection..
