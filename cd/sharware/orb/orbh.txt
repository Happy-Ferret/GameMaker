     Planetary Report # 1

This information has been made
with the help of the broadcast
from a  probe  we sent  to the
Aggressor  world.   This probe
had also  dropped ten  weapons
in various places on the world
for your use.  This probe also
observed several creatures who
were close to the landing site
we have chosen for you.  Below
are a few descriptions of what
we found and some advise given
in light of said observations.

Unfortunately, the weapons are
no longer where we  left them.
We beleive  the computers  can
control some  of the creatures
and  as a  result  the weapons
have been misplaced.

From observations of creatures
on, or in, the planet, we have
determined what we call the HP
scale.  This  is used  to find
out what weapon will kill what
creatures or destroy what dev-
ices.   These are the results.
The description of the weapons
follows.

Orb of Water..............25HP
Orb of Fire...............45HP
Orb of Magma..............65HP
Orb of Lightning..........85HP
Orb of Stone..............65HP
Orb of Harm..............105HP
Orb of Defence...........125HP
Orb of Destruction.......125HP
Orb of Apocalypse........145HP
Orb of Antimatter........165HP

The Orb of Water fires a small
but deadly bubble  killing any
creature  of  below 25HP.  The
Orb of Fire fires a small bolt
of flame.  The Orb of Magma is
able to fire a  ball of Magma.
The Orb of Lightning fires out
a bolt of  electrical  energy.
The Orb of Stone creates stone
in the air used more  for aide
in climbing  rather than  as a
weapon.  The Orb of Harm fires
a small bomb.  A small ball of
ambiplasma is  fired when  the
Orb of Defense is used, but it
does not act  as a missile but
as a force that stays close to
you for a short period of time
often  getting in  the way  of
attacking creatures. When used
the Orb of Destruction propels
a small missile that kills any
below  125HP.     The  Orb  of
Apocalypse  fires a larger one
killing any creature below 145
HP.  The Orb of  Antimatter is
the most potent  killing below
165HP  with a  small pellet of
antimatter, which  reacts with
harm  anything  made  of  our
matter.

Most of this  world's wildlife
lives below  ground  in  large
and vast caverns.   The people
who used to live here, though,
left  behind  several  cities,
some  ancient,  some new, some
wartorn,  while others  mostly
undamaged.    Some  structures
have even  been detected below
the surface.   There  seems to
be two  classes of  life.  One
is very large, usually trained
and  dangerous,   and  usually
guarding keys.   Many of these
attack by breathing  fire.  It
is suggested that you can stop
them  from  breathing  fire by
getting  right  in their face.
They should  temporarily  lose
some  of  the gas  they breath
that they use to blow fire and
so can  no longer  fire.   But
if you don't do this, they may
leave  you with  a few parting
shots when  they  are  killed.
Other than these big monsters,
there are  countless,  usually
smaller, creatures  that would
hinder  your  progess.     Pay
particular attention to spiked
fliers that  with  follow  and
attack, and  deadly  burrowing
worms.   In  the  cities,  you
should  watch  out  for   more
automated foes,  some of which
can deliver  immediately fatal
blows.

The Alien  who contacted us is
in one of the  cities, and has
collected  three  of  the most
potent  weapons  we sent down.
From  what  we could  tell, he
was  a  miner  who found  that
this world  was rich in energy
producing  crystals,  and  was
caught here  when the computer
suddenly  decided  to   go  on
alert when  detecting us.   He
needs  four varieties  of gems
to power  his  craft,  but can
no longer  leave  his hideout.
He had  lost many  shovels and
hammers  in the caverns, which
you  could use  to  get  these
gems for him.   He hinted that
he may not  be willing  to let
go  of those  three weapons if
you do not, so collect all you
can.

There are also energy capsules
down  there  in the  shape  of
hearts.  We  beleive  they may
have been  left behind  by the
prior inhabitants of the world
probably  after they  fled the
world when  the malfunctioning
defense  system  began harming
its  creators.   We  may never
know,  but nevertheless,  your
mission  is  clear.   Take out
the  computer  mainframe   for
the defense-offense systems.

Good luck.
