This game wouldn't be possible
without my computer and a half
ruined Microcassette recorder,
a few good tapes, an excellent
SoundBlaster system, a few new
pens, a lot of graphpaper, and
my very fat Norwegian Elkhound
named Thor who was for most of
the monsters in this game, and
for a few of the sounds in the
game, my inspiration. The rest
of the monsters Merry, Pippin,
and Isis...  in order two loud
parakeets and a pest of a cat,
are responsible for. GAMEMAKER
is, however,  more responsible
than any other for this master
piece, and deserves due thanks
from I as well as from any who 
enjoy playing this game.
