
   ORB -The Derelict Planet

You will not see anyone who is
famous I'm afraid, and neither
will this be an extensive cast
considering I created the game
alone.  This game, however, is
not quite a third of the whole
thing, which has ten levels as
well a post-victory escape and
several secret passages. There
are new and tougher levels and
creatures, more deadly weapons
and new tools to use. Rendered
scenes will enliven each facet
of the game, and, of course, a
mysterious alien may give aide
to you in your quest.  Perhaps
you have some chance, but then
again, perhaps not.  Take on a
myriad of flying lizards, tons
of Orb-eating plants, enormous
worms, only the heads of which
are visible above ground. Slay
invisible monsters in towering
towers, or plants with eyes on
the floors of canyons. Avoid a
sting from a chopperlike thing
or dodge the fiery breath that
seems almost to chase you from
deep within dark caverns while
jumping over little worms with
enormous razor-sharp teeth and
quills.  Enter cities both new
and battle-torn.  Be wary of a
live wire or a small tank with
a fatal needle.  Blow holes in
walls to step in, while trying
to avoid the spikes of a large
flying device, or try to avoid
being carried to your death by
escalator-like floors.  Defeat
the defenses of the main-frame
computer if you can. Somehow I
don't think you'll make it the
first ten times you'll try!

   Have an nice day!

P.S. ORDER.DOC has the order
     instructions.
