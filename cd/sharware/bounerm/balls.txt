 You  were  an  ordinary  guy,
well,  at least pretty  ordin-
ary.  While  walking down  the
street one day, you saw a lit-
tle green crystal on the side-
walk. You picked it up, and as
soon as you did so,  your mind
started swirling. The sidewalk
turned green  and the sky into
a mass  of purple  waves.  You
regain  your senses,  but feel
sort of  strange.  You  try to
stand up,  but you  don't feel
any legs.  You attempt to look
around,  but  you  can't  turn
your neck.  You can,  however,
roll around.  You gaze at your
reflection in a polished spike
jutting  from the  ground  and
see a rubber ball. You yelp at
this,  although you don't hear
your voice,  and hop back. . .
about ten feet. When you land,
you bounce  another three feet
or so. Suddenly, a voice booms
out of the sky.

 "You are now a bounerim.  You
are my  prisoner.  Don't  even
contemplate    escaping.    My
guards will pop you before you
can even start to roll."

 You stop to think of what has
happened, and realize that the
green crystal had to have been
what  did this.  You know that
you  somehow  have to  get  it
back.  You roll  forward a bit
and see a  strange purple hole
in the middle of nothing.  You
get  excited and when  you run
for it,  you  all of a  sudden
see  about  a hundred  percent
better  than   before   and  a
swirling  beam of light  comes
from  your  pupil.  You think,
"This  is  a   strange  place,
      whatever it is."
