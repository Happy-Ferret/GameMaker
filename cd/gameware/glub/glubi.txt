When you shoot an enemy, you
 enclose him in a bubble. If
  you shoot him again, you
   burst the bubble.

To finish a round, kill all of
 the enemies in the round and
  collect the bubbles left be-
   hind. When you have enough
    bubbles, you can open the
     treasure chest. Use the
      gold from the chest in
       the coin-operated
        transportation device
         to leave the round.

The only way to get to some
 places is to jump out of the
  water.
