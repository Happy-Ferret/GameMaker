
TUTOR is  not a game.  It is a
demonstration of some of Game-
Maker's features.  
 
Move  the character around the
scene  with  the  arrow  keys.
You  will be able  to  observe
and  experience  the following
Game-Maker capabilities.   

* Scrolling and scrolling con-
trol.  TUTOR has scrolling set
to permit horizontal scrolling
only.

*  Solid blocks stop the char-
acter.

*  One way doors.  Blocks with
one  solid  side  prevent  the
character  from  entering  the
block from one side, but allow
it  to move through the  block
from the other sides.

*  Shooting.  Press the  space
key to try it out.

*  Blocks can change upon con-
tact  with the character  into
other blocks.

*  The  character  can  change
into another  character as you
travel from level to level.

*  Blocks  can  change after a
set time has elapsed.  You can
use  this  feature  to  create
background animation by having
blocks    change   into  other
blocks in rapid succession.

* Blocks can change on contact
and  on  time.   TUTOR shows a
case where  block  "1" changes
to "2" and  block  "3"  to "4"
and  then  back to  the  first
blocks based on time.  But "1"
also changes to "3" and "4" to
"1"  upon   contact  with  the
character.   You  can  set  up
some  tricky  stuff with  this
arrangement.

*  Gravity.  It pulls you this
way and that.

*  Keys and Doors. You can set
up  'special  counters'   that
force  you to contact  one  or
more  blocks, such as pictures
of  keys, before another block
will change,  such  as  a door
changing to an open door.
