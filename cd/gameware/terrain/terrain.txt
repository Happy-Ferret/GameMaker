TERRAIN will show  you how the
'Terrain'  picture  blocks can
be used in a scene.    Terrain
is not really a game, but  you
may  roam   around  the  scene
using the arrow  keys  or  the
numeric  keypad  keys and  get
some    ideas    of   some  of
GAME-MAKER'S capabilities.

The 'p' key picks  up objects.
You  had  better  pick up  the
lazer gun.  The 'd' key  drops
objects.  The  numeric  keypad
keys  1, 3, 7,  and  9  shoot.
The   Space  Bar  shoots  four
ways.     The  'b'  key  drops
bombs, if  you have any.  Stay
clear of the bombs you drop.
