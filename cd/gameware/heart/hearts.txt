The labs at Earth's station on
the recently-terraformed Venus
have sent down a self-propel-
led ball of uranium, dubbed 
"Patchwork Heart", deep into
the crust of the planet,to de-
stroy the horrid monsters that
appeared soon after the star-
ship Zark destroyed the invad-
ing aliens. The creatures ap-
pear to be the animated organs
of the huge monster Zark flew
through and destroyed. The
radiation should hold the mon-
sters at bay, yet in case it
doesn't, a special amplifi-
cation crystal was installed.
