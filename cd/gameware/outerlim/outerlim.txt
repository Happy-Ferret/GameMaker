       THE OUTER LIMITS

  The Outer  Limits  is a game
based on the  B&W T.V.  series
from  the  early 60's.    This
game    uses  parts  from  two
episodes:      "The    Cry  of
Silence"    and  the    "Zanti
Misfits". 

  You  play  the role  of  the
girl that is now left alone in
the canyon.  The strange weeds
seem  to   be  aware  of  your
presence.  Overhead there is a
flying saucer that appears  to
"come and go" for some  as yet
unknown reason.

  Hint:  you must utilize  the
Zanti Misfits  (large ant-like
critters) to remove  the weeds
blocking the exit.

  Can   you  get  out  of  the
canyon alive?    Look  for the
arrows that "pop up" every now
and then.  GOOD LUCK!
