   UP, DOWN,  LEFT, RIGHT:
  Walk in those  directions

         SPACE BAR:
     Use bladed weapon

            2-5:
  Use various other weapons

             1:
  Throw eggplants  (if any)

     Q-T ON QWERTY ROW:
      Use magic spells


  SUGGESTIONS FROM THE ELDER:

   At  the outset,  you should
first  drop  all of the  items
you're  carrying,  as most  do
nothing at all. 

   Next, go to the weapon shop
and  get a  knife.  The  armor
doesn't really do anything, so
don't waste your money.

   Your first task  is to find
the first  cave.  Upon finding
it,  get up enough strength to
brave  the terrors  inside be-
fore entering.  If you  cannot
find it, go  to the  main menu
and don't  touch any  keys for
about 30 seconds.  A demo will
run which brings the character
through these first steps.

   Once  it  (I'm  not telling
what  IT is)  is found  in the
cave,  you must  enter all the
others (once you find IT,  you
will be able to circumvent the
yellow  barrier),  trying   to
find a way off the planet.

         GOOD LUCK!!
