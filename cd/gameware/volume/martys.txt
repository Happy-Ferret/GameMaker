       CHAPTER I

   After  getting  through the
daily hell called high school,
Marty   headed   home.   After
stepping into the nearest bus,
he  sat  down  in  the  prized
position of  Farthest  Seat in
the Back.
  "Strange," he thought. "Usu-
ally  everyone is surging  for
this seat,  but there's no one
in here.  What's goin' on? Are
the cheerleaders  putting on a
game  of  strip  poker  in the
gym, or what?"
   All of a sudden,  the world
turned into a big yellow blur.
Once  everything seemed stable
again,  Marty climbed out from
under  the  seat.  "Hey,  this
isn't OZ!"  Peeking out of the
window,   Marty  learned  that
this  was  not the 90's.
  He deduced this by observing
a large metal earlobe casually
flap by.  "Well, well,  a time
warp...  time  warp?   Wait  a
second."
   Once he finished  pondering
this  subject,  Marty  noticed
that it had gotten pitch black
outside.  Lighting a  match on
the back of his hand, he stood
up.  "Whet's el  de  screamin'
'bout bak thar,"  Marty  heard
from  the   blackness  at  the
front of the vehicle.
   The  bus  driver,  who  had
blue  hair and  eyes as big as
grapefruits jumped out the win
dow,  howling  something.  Not
wishing  to   be  devoured  by
whatever  it was,  although he
never  actually  saw  it  back
there, Marty, too rushed away.


        CHAPTER II

   Soon later, Marty came upon
another  native.   The  person
turned  around,  and Marty no-
ticed his  purple  hair.  "Why
does  everyone here  look like
he's  from  a  Japaneese  car-
toon," he asked. 
   "You must go to the town of
Ishmaiel  immidiately!   World
the  fate of  the known  is in
your  hands,"  the  native re-
sponded. 
   "Hmm... all right.  But how
do I  get  back to  the  past?
And how did I get here?" 
   "You  must defeat  the evil
lord  to reopen  the time port
that brought," he said.
   "What   language  are   you
speaking," pondered Marty.
   "English   translated  from
Japaneese."
   "Oh. Of course."
   So here your jouney begins.
You must decide  Marty's fate.
As for me,  I'll go play A-J's
Quest (c).

          GOOD LUCK!
