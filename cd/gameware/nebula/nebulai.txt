Movement: Joystick
          Numerical keypad

Spit Fireball: <Space bar>

Pick up Objects: the 'P' key

You do not have the  power to
spit fire at first.  Find the
Yellow orb in  the blue world
(and pick it up) to gain this
ability. There is also a more
powerful  fireball  hidden in
the game, so look carefully!
