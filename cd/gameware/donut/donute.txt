    "Crulla!"  Crullo cried --
actually, he  didn't, but,  if
donuts could  talk,   he would
have.  He hugged  her the best
way a donut  could  and  real-
ized that the witch  must have
dropped her.  They had  better
leave before  she got back, so
out  they  went,  back  to the
bakery  --  donuts  aren't too
bright,  you  know --  to live
happily ever after.
    Do you  believe  that will
happen there?  Do you honestly
think  that  no-one  will  buy
them,  or  even  worse,  throw
them in  the trash  after they
have  been  rolling  around on
the floor? . . . . You do not!
