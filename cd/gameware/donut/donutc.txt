Edit this at your leisure.
If I may say so, this would
be a great game to test your
new characters in before put-
ting them in your own game.
For practice, you might want
to add more levels to this
game, such as a fire castle,
where the walls are all burn-
ing and flickering. Maybe an
air castle, with invisible
walls and clouds as back-
ground. Or possibly a steel
castle, with all kinds of
peculiar gizmos in it.
