Actually, I lied. :) there are
a  couple  of other  people to
credit. -->

When I asked  my mother, "What
the heck can I do for a game?"
she decided to have one of her
odd moments and say "A donut".
As I was desperate, I tried it
out, and  strangely enough, it
worked! /:o
And  Ollie,  for providing the
motivation   to   finish  this
darned thing - I love starting
a game, but hate to finish the
doodads -- too much work. =}.
