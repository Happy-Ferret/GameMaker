    Aderack Enoob  is what you
are called, and  your homeland
is - was  called  Roant, until
the Evelsherk  Zachan arrived.
He  conjured  up monsters  too
fearsome  to speak of and soon
became ruler of the land.
    Needless  to say, he  also
took  the princess, Dusk Rose,
with    him   to   his empiric
fortress. The people  now hide
inside   towns,   the  bravest
joining clubs of warriors, who
go on  raids, destroying every
monster in sight.
    You are one of these - the
best and most  famous warrior.
The king  summoned you  a  few
moments ago.  You weren't told
why you  were called, but it's
not hard to guess - populatity
is not always all it's cracked
up to be.
    You  arrive  at the king's
chamber. The guards let you in
without  challenge.   When you
approach the  throne, the king
begins to speak.  He tells you
that  you have  been chosen to
destroy Zachan.  You begin  to
protest, as you  know  you are
not  powerful  enough  for the
task, but the  king signals to
stay your tounge. He begins to
explain his reasons.
    Your   ancestor,   Cireneg
Hugwoh, defeated the Evelsherk
once before, using five  magic
rings.  As his  decendant, you
are the only one who can wield
these rings.  You must  locate
them,  as  well  as  the  very
helmet,  armor,  and shield he
wore;  otherwise  you  will be
killed  instantly  by Zachan's
evil magic.
    In addition, while Cireneg
needed the  rings  to   defeat
Zachan, he  dealt the  killing
blow  with  a lightning  sword
he  crafted.   This  is   also
neccesary for you  to succeed.
    As  you think  about  this
information, the  king signals
to a  robed  old  man whom you
hadn't noticed before. The man
points his index finger at you
and mumbles some gibberish.  A
strange feeling comes over you
and a couple  bolts of  yellow
fire  wander up  and down your
body for a moment. The elderly
figure  tells  you  that  your
mystical  powers   have   been
increased threefold.   You now
have  the  potential  to  cast
spells.  You  don't  know  the
words  or  gestures  to  them,
though, so you must find books
in which these are written.
    You  are  then  dismissed,
and  asked to start the  quest
immediately.
