Princess  Dusk  Rose has  been
recovered by  your valiant ef-
forts.  Now you  and  she  can
finish  driving  the remaining
enemies away.  Gradually,  the
lands will rebuild their deci-
mated  standards  of  harmony.
The old king is grateful,  and
appoints   you   commander  of
Roant's  Royal  Guard,  second
only to Dusk Rose, herself.  A
few days after your opponent's
defeat, Dusk Rose has you sum-
moned to the  her office.  She
was  impressed by  your valor,
and has become very  attracted
to  you.  She's made  arrange-
ments  for you to  get married
soon.  You gladly accept,  and
to use a much-overused cliche,

You lived happily  ever after.



          THE END.
