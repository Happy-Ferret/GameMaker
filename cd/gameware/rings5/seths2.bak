Aderack Enoob is what you are
called, and your homeland is -
was called Roant, until the
Evelsherk  Zachan arrived. He
conjured up monsters too fear-
some to speak of and soon be-
came ruler of the land. Need-
less to say, he also took the
princess, Dusk Rose, with him
to his empiric fortress. The
people now hide inside towns,
the bravest joining clubs of
warriors, who go on raids, de-
stroying every monster in
sight. You are one of these -
the best and most celebrated
one. The king called you a few
moments ago. You weren't told
why you were summoned, but
it's not hard to guess - popu-
latity is not always all it's
cracked up to be. You arrive
at the king's chamber. The
guards let you in without a
question. When you approach
the throne, the king begins to
speak. He tells you what you
thought he would, that you
have been cosen to destroy
Zachan. You begin to protest,
as you know you are not power-
ful enough for the task, but
the king signals to stay your
lips. He begins to explain his
reasons. Your ancestor, Cire-
neg Hugwoh, defeated the Evel-
sherk once before, using five
magical rings. As his decend-
ant, you are the only one who
can weild these rings. You
must locate them, as well as
the very helmet, armor, and
shield he wore, else you would
be killed instantly by Zach-
an's evil Magic. In addition,
while Cireneg used the rings
to defeat Zachan, he dealt the
final blow with a lightning
sword he crafted.  This is al-
so neccesary for your journey.
As you process this data, the
king mumbles to a robed old
man who you hadn't seen be-
fore. The man points his index
finger at you and mumbles some
gibberish. A strange feeling
comes over you, and a couple
bolts of electricity wander up
and down your body for a mo-
ment. The elderly figure re-
ports to you that your powers
have been increased threefold
and whenever you are in an im-
mensely dangerous situation,
you would grow to fully thrice
your current size and would be
able to cast spells so power-
ful that any other mortal man
would die casting them. You
don't know the words or gest-
ures to them, though, so you
must find books in which these
are written.  In addition to
this, you have been given mi-
nor telekinetic powers, and
are now able to swing a weapon
merely by thinking about it.
You are dismissed abruptly,
and are asked to leave.
