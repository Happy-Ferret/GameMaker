An evil race from  Alpha  Cen-
turai is approaching your base
on  Venus.   The stupid planet
just got  terraformed, and now
an alien race is coming to de-
molish it.  Great, just great.

Wanna' hear more?  You've been
chosen as an ambassador.   Am-
bassador?    What  the ____ do
they  think    they're  doing?
These alien things  are coming
with guns and who  knows  what
else  to  destroy  the  place.
Ambassador?      More  like  a
blimmin' leader  of  a suicide
trek  into  the  enemy  filled
void.    Space  is   dangerous
'nough without any aliens!

Well,   you  take  the    most
powerful  ship  on  Venus  and
prepare for trouble.....
