    Game-Maker software, documentation,  and  data  files  are  furnished
    under a license agreement,  and may be copied only in accordance with
    the terms of the license  agreement.  Good News!  This license allows
    distribution of games to up to  ten  friends  free of royalties.  You
    may also distribute games as Shareware without  needing  to  obtain a
    formal  license.    Game-Maker  provides  a  software utility  called
    "Transfer"  that packages the games you design onto diskettes,  ready
    for  distribution.    For commercial distribution of games, check the
    Owner's manual  to  read  about  the standard royalty terms.  Contact
    Recreational Software Designs if you need special commercial terms.
