The SAMPLE  game shows many of
Game-Maker's features.   A two
block high character walks  in
four directions, shoots, drops
bombs, picks  up  items,  gets
hurt, and dies.  

Arrow keys move the character,
as  does a joystick.   On  the
numeric  keyboard,  keys 2, 4,
6, and 8 act as arrow keys.  

In  order  to shoot the laser,
you need to first  pick it up.
Inorder to shoot the revolver,
you    need  to  pick  it  and
its  ammo  up.  You start with
five bombs,  and  can  pick up
others.

The  space  bar   shoots  four
laser  monsters away from  the
character.   The 'b' key  sets
down bombs which explode.  Key
5  shoots  bullets.    On  the
numeric keypad, the  1,  3, 7,
and 9 keys shoot single lasers
various ways.   
 
The  character starts with 250
hit points  and  3 lives.  The
objective is to  pick  up  the
Book of Wisdom.   To  do this,
you must eat enough hamburgers
to   get  strength,  find  two
keys, and  fight  through  the
maze -- and  you  are going to
need a sword.

Monsters  subtract hit points,
food  adds  hit points.   Most
monsters  can  be  killed, but
some  are  too  strong  to  be
killed by a laser.
