The startup code does several things before going to the main()
function.  If any one of these fails, it will abort and display
the "Abnormal Program Termination" message; this message is
printed whenever the function abort() is invoked.

The startup code will abort if:

    (1) There is not enough memory to load the program.

        Workaround: Free up memory before running program.
                    clean out system, run from DOS, not
                    environment.

    (2) There is not enough memory to expand the stack.

        Workaround: As above, reduce the stack size.

    (3) If environment space is bad, TC checks the environment,
        The user may have overwritten lower memory prior to
        trying to load program.

    (4) If EMU (the floating point emulator) cannot initialize.
        The EMU needs to take some space from the stack, and if
        the stack isn't big enough, the program will abort.

    (5) If overlay system cannot initialize. Usually memory
        problem.

    (6) If there is not enough heapspace.

  Notice that in most cases, the problem is a lack of memory.

One possible solution may arise if the person is working from the
TC++/BC++ Programmers Platform.  The PP takes all of the memory
in the system when in runs.  When you want to run one of your
programs from inside the PP, memory is freed to the total of the
size of the load image of your program + 64K by default.  This
amount can be changed through Options|Debugger|Program Heap Size.
Try setting this value to a higher value and attempt to run the
program again.
